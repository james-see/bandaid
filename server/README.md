# SERVER

The server is meant to run continuously as a way to keep all of the bands in the world in sync with on tour / not on tour status as well as current dates and tour locations.


## SETUP

Coming soon.

The plan is to add a supervisord based installer that will run at the system level to continuous and randomly index and reindex band pages as they change.
